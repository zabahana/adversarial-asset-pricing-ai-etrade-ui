# Streamlit Running Locally

## 🚀 App Started

The Streamlit app should now be running!

## 🌐 Access

Open in your browser: **http://localhost:8501**

## 📊 Viewing Logs

### Terminal Output
All logs appear in the terminal where you ran the command:
- ✅ Training progress (episodes, loss)
- ✅ Model evaluation status
- ✅ File operations
- ✅ Errors and warnings
- ✅ Completion messages

### Real-Time Updates
- Logs update as analysis runs
- You'll see progress in real-time
- Status changes are logged immediately

## 🔍 Debugging UI Display

When you run an analysis:

1. **Watch terminal logs** - See exactly what's happening
2. **Check browser console** (F12) - See JavaScript errors
3. **Look for completion** - Logs show when analysis finishes
4. **Check file paths** - Logs show where results are saved

## 📋 What to Look For

In the logs, watch for:
- `[COMPLETE] Model evaluation complete. Results saved to: results/amzn_model_results.json`
- `[FORECAST] ✅ Forecast generated: BUY with +X.XX% change`
- Status updates: `Training complete`, `Evaluation complete`

## ✅ Expected Flow

1. Analysis starts → Logs show initialization
2. Training runs → Logs show episode progress
3. Evaluation → Logs show metrics
4. Results saved → Logs show file path
5. UI should update → Results display automatically
